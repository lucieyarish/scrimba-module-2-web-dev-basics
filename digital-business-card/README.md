# Digital Business Card

A tiny project built to practice HTML and CSS.

Having completed this project, I learned/reviewed the following topics:

- Image `alt` text: what they are & what to include in them
- Flex child containers
- Inheritance
- Shorthand properties
- Web-safe fonts
- Color palettes
